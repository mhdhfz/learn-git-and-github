    version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files

concepts of git
    - keeps track of code history
    - takes snapshots of files

    - you can stage files before commiting

basic commands

    git rm --cached file - remove file from staging area
    git status - check status of working tree
    git commit - commit changes in index
    git commit -m 'message' - to commit with a message
    git push - push to remote repository
    git pull - pull latest from remote repository
    git clone - clone repository into a new directory
    .gitignore - file / folder we dont want to add at repository by add filename or folder directory on .gitignore file
    git branch - create another line from master to ensure we dont spoil the code on master
